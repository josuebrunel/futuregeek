Hi guys !! I'm **_Josue Kouka_** (yeah i know, tough to pronounce), a young
free software and open-source enthusiast, fond of programming and thirsty of
knowledge.

This little blog is about stuff that i like, by that i mean a lot of **Linux
and Programming** (yeah sounds like fun ^_^). I talk about personal and
projects in which i'm involved(Not a lot right now).

Articles will be either in English or in French (sometimes both when i can),
and to make it fun to read, i will do my best to refer to some _memes_. I use
**emacs** as my main text editor/IDE. You can check emacs for python out if
you interested into programming with emacs.

I think that it's almost all you need to know about me , don't hesitate to
contact me at [josuebrunel@gmail.com](mailto:josuebrunel@gmail.com)
